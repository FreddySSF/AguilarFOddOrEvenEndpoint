# AguilarFOddOrEvenEndpoint

// Opening the file AguilarFOddOrEvenEndpoint in vs code, turn on the debug feture and let it run. Once it has finished running the
// localhost page will show up and say it can't be found. Return to the debug console in vs sharp and copy + paste the http url ( example: http://localhost:5250 ).
// Open up Postman in your web browser and create a new http request. Paste the http into the request. You type in / and then the name of the controller
// including what goes in after the route in parenthesis. With another dash you input the value you wish for {number1}.
// Enter send and the url should output into postman whether the number chosen by the user {number1} is an odd number or an even number!

// Peer Reviewed By: Jasmine Leek- code runs as expected, I really like how straightforward it reads. good work!
